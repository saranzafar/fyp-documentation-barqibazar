\end{center}

All praise and glory go to Allah, who has blessed us with the courage and knowledge to achieve our goal. We can never thank Him enough for His countless blessings on us. Praise Prophet Mohammad (SAW), who is and will always be a source of guidance and knowledge for humanity.

For us, a milestone of this nature would never have been possible without the support of a galaxy of some truly loving and kind people in our life. No words can fully describe our feelings of respect and gratitude for our affectionate parents, supporting sibling and friends, whose love, encouragement, and prayers invariably buoyed us up. Your concern, love and support can never be paid back.

We owe a lot of sincere gratitude to our respected supervisor, Dr. Khurrum Mustafa Abbasi and our respected teachers, whose true guidance, positive criticism, and sincere encouragement made us get to our destination. He became a source of inspiration for us and kept us moving in the right direction towards our goal.
