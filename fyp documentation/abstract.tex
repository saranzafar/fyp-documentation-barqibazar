This project proposes Barqi Bazar, a service oriented smart commerce platform that addresses key challenges in local retail operations, including lack of digital integration, uncontrolled online product listings, and inefficient coordination between stores, customers, and delivery riders. The system integrates an offline capable Point of Sale (POS) system with administrative portals for controlled product approval and a centralized platform for order processing and delivery management. By enabling structured product proposals, stock validation, rider bidding, and city based franchise management, Barqi Bazar provides a scalable and controlled approach to bridge offline retail with online commerce. The proposed system improves operational efficiency, ensures product quality, and supports coordinated delivery services across multiple cities and franchises.
